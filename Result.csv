While booking we clearly showed the decor setup and the space details and also informed that its a small space. Also while booking we clearly mentioned that we do not encourage more prople but the client said you ll be adjusting the space and total of 8 people came. We have our concerns with air due to humidity and open space. The organiser were present in the place during the start of the event and asked the people who came if they had any concerns and they said everything is okay. All the problems stated above were not conveyed during the starting of the event but in the last during payment to reduce the payment but the service were fully used well by the customer. Also the slot that was booked by you was 5:30 to 7:30. You came late around 6:15.
Above all this, we try to serve the best for customers and would have even provided refund but one thing we do not support and do not encourge is customers shouting in front of our cafe and harrasing our employees which was done by you. We dont encourage people who shout at us post using our services fully and falsely accusing us that the decoration was not done as per photos while we provided it with at-most details.

While booking we clearly showed the decor setup and the space details and also informed that its a small space. Also while booking we clearly mentioned that we do not encourage more prople but the client said you ll be adjusting the space and total of 8 people came. We have our concerns with air due to humidity and open space. The organiser were present in the place during the start of the event and asked the people who came if they had any concerns and they said everything is okay. All the problems stated above were not conveyed during the starting of the event but in the last during payment to reduce the payment but the service were fully used well by the customer. Also the slot that was booked by you was 5:30 to 7:30. You came late around 6:15.
Above all this, we try to serve the best for customers and would have even provided refund but one thing we do not support and do not encourge is customers shouting in front of our cafe and harrasing our employees which was done by you. We dont encourage people who shout at us post using our services fully and falsely accusing us that the decoration was not done as per photos while we provided it with at-most details.

While booking we clearly showed the decor setup and the space details and also informed that its a small space. Also while booking we clearly mentioned that we do not encourage more prople but the client said you ll be adjusting the space and total of 8 people came. We have our concerns with air due to humidity and open space. The organiser were present in the place during the start of the event and asked the people who came if they had any concerns and they said everything is okay. All the problems stated above were not conveyed during the starting of the event but in the last during payment to reduce the payment but the service were fully used well by the customer. Also the slot that was booked by you was 5:30 to 7:30. You came late around 6:15.
Above all this, we try to serve the best for customers and would have even provided refund but one thing we do not support and do not encourge is customers shouting in front of our cafe and harrasing our employees which was done by you. We dont encourage people who shout at us post using our services fully and falsely accusing us that the decoration was not done as per photos while we provided it with at-most details.

While booking we clearly showed the decor setup and the space details and also informed that its a small space. Also while booking we clearly mentioned that we do not encourage more prople but the client said you ll be adjusting the space and total of 8 people came. We have our concerns with air due to humidity and open space. The organiser were present in the place during the start of the event and asked the people who came if they had any concerns and they said everything is okay. All the problems stated above were not conveyed during the starting of the event but in the last during payment to reduce the payment but the service were fully used well by the customer. Also the slot that was booked by you was 5:30 to 7:30. You came late around 6:15.
Above all this, we try to serve the best for customers and would have even provided refund but one thing we do not support and do not encourge is customers shouting in front of our cafe and harrasing our employees which was done by you. We dont encourage people who shout at us post using our services fully and falsely accusing us that the decoration was not done as per photos while we provided it with at-most details.

While booking we clearly showed the decor setup and the space details and also informed that its a small space. Also while booking we clearly mentioned that we do not encourage more prople but the client said you ll be adjusting the space and total of 8 people came. We have our concerns with air due to humidity and open space. The organiser were present in the place during the start of the event and asked the people who came if they had any concerns and they said everything is okay. All the problems stated above were not conveyed during the starting of the event but in the last during payment to reduce the payment but the service were fully used well by the customer. Also the slot that was booked by you was 5:30 to 7:30. You came late around 6:15.
Above all this, we try to serve the best for customers and would have even provided refund but one thing we do not support and do not encourge is customers shouting in front of our cafe and harrasing our employees which was done by you. We dont encourage people who shout at us post using our services fully and falsely accusing us that the decoration was not done as per photos while we provided it with at-most details.

While booking we clearly showed the decor setup and the space details and also informed that its a small space. Also while booking we clearly mentioned that we do not encourage more prople but the client said you ll be adjusting the space and total of 8 people came. We have our concerns with air due to humidity and open space. The organiser were present in the place during the start of the event and asked the people who came if they had any concerns and they said everything is okay. All the problems stated above were not conveyed during the starting of the event but in the last during payment to reduce the payment but the service were fully used well by the customer. Also the slot that was booked by you was 5:30 to 7:30. You came late around 6:15.
Above all this, we try to serve the best for customers and would have even provided refund but one thing we do not support and do not encourge is customers shouting in front of our cafe and harrasing our employees which was done by you. We dont encourage people who shout at us post using our services fully and falsely accusing us that the decoration was not done as per photos while we provided it with at-most details.

While booking we clearly showed the decor setup and the space details and also informed that its a small space. Also while booking we clearly mentioned that we do not encourage more prople but the client said you ll be adjusting the space and total of 8 people came. We have our concerns with air due to humidity and open space. The organiser were present in the place during the start of the event and asked the people who came if they had any concerns and they said everything is okay. All the problems stated above were not conveyed during the starting of the event but in the last during payment to reduce the payment but the service were fully used well by the customer. Also the slot that was booked by you was 5:30 to 7:30. You came late around 6:15.
Above all this, we try to serve the best for customers and would have even provided refund but one thing we do not support and do not encourge is customers shouting in front of our cafe and harrasing our employees which was done by you. We dont encourage people who shout at us post using our services fully and falsely accusing us that the decoration was not done as per photos while we provided it with at-most details. We have done more than 200+ parties and continue to serve our customers well with kindness with the same been reciprocated to our employees.",neutral,0.4899246394634247
