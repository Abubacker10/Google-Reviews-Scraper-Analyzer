Dear Kurinji vijay,

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback about your recent visit to our outlet. We apologize for the disappointing experience, especially since you've been loyal customers since our opening.

We want to acknowledge that today was indeed the first day for some of our new staff members, who were still getting familiar with our systems and procedures. Unfortunately, they hadn't received their uniforms yet, which didn't meet our usual standards.

Please know that we take your comments seriously and are taking immediate action to ensure our new team members receive the proper training and equipment to meet our high standards. We're committed to maintaining the quality and atmosphere that you've come to expect from us.

We hope you'll give us another chance to show you the true spirit of our coffee shop. If you'd like to discuss further or have any suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Kindly try to re-review after your next visit.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support.",neutral,0.5685491561889648

Hi Santha, Apologies for missing to your concern, we are a low margin brand delivering the best anyone could. Sadly the aggregators require 30% out of the sale amount, requiring a percentage towards the ad, also without an offer running our outlet won’t even get listed for you to order.

We don’t prefer these but some our customers requested us to be listed for their convenience and that’s why we are there. We recommend you enjoying us in person going forward. Hope to see you change the rating soon.",neutral,0.6288608908653259

Dear Taarun,

Thank you so much for taking the time to write us such a wonderful review! We're thrilled to hear that you enjoyed our coffee and appreciate your kind words.

We understand your concern regarding the seating arrangements and we apologize for any inconvenience caused. Though we are operating in kiosk (which has its own limitations) we recently rented the opposite space and made a little seating arrangement there to provide a more comfortable experience for our customers. Although it may not accommodate more people at a time, we did the best we could. We take our customers' feedback seriously and we will continue to look for ways to improve our space to make it more welcoming.

Thank you again for your support and recommendation. We hope to see you soon and provide you with an even better experience",positive,0.8240867257118225

This is a fantastic place if you are in mood for some sweets, pastries or some great cuisine ! The price is very nominal as-well. They do have dine in service as-well. Only thing is the car parking is very less . You will end up hunting for a car space.

Review for Confectionery: When ordering I asked the guy on the counter if the fresh pineapple cake has real pineapple he said yes. and the cake was dry just some yellow Sirup added. After ordering a couple of Pastries everything tastes artificial . Well they really need to improve on quality and taste.

Ambience is ❤. Freshly grounded coffee's are top notch. Normal cakes are dope. The Bluberry Cheesecake was rubbery with some strong yeast flavour in it, hazelnut cheesecake was super soft bt the flavour was blunt nd sweetness was high. Spl falooda did justice.

We went by 12:30 am with our fur baby, yes it's a pet friendly place. Food is good. It felt a little chaotic with all the waiting for the food. Some scope for improvement there.

Dear Daffodil Richard,

Wow, thank you for such a detailed and positive review! We're thrilled you enjoyed your experience at Renaissance Brew Co. It sounds like everything hit the spot - the ambience, the price range, the delicious hot chocolate and fries, and even the tempting burger you saw next door! We love hearing that our place is perfect for dates, hanging out, conversations, and chilling out.

We appreciate you mentioning the menu limitations for vegetarians. We focus on creating high-quality dishes with fresh ingredients, but we understand the desire for more variety. We'll definitely consider expanding our vegetarian options in the future.

Thanks for mentioning the accessibility limitations - the terrace location without a lift or wheelchair access is definitely something to keep in mind for some guests. We appreciate you highlighting the comfortable seating and aesthetics too!

Overall, we're so happy you'll be back! Welcome back anytime - we look forward to seeing you again soon.

Sincerely,

The Team at Renaissance Brew Co",positive,0.952964723110199

We're thrilled you had a 5-star experience! It sounds like the perfect evening at Renaissance Brew Co - a delicious hot chocolate (possibly the best!), a relaxed vibe, and a hip atmosphere. We love that you felt comfortable bringing your family and wife.

Creating a welcoming space for everyone is important to us, and it's fantastic to hear we achieved that for you. The young crowd is a great testament to our trendy atmosphere, but we're happy it maintains a relaxed feel.

Thanks for mentioning the hot chocolate! We put a lot of care into our beverage selection, so hearing it was the best is wonderful praise.

We hope to see you all again soon!
