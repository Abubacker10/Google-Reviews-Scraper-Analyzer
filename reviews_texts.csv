I had ordered a ginger tea and the lady in the shop said that there was no ginger, so I changed my order. After a while, a couple had come and they ordered two ginger teas. From the conversation they had with the shop people, I could gather that they were regulars there. The shop lady immediately said okay and accepted their order. When I asked why I was told there was no ginger, another lady said that they misunderstood the order and was trying to get away with the situation. Seemed like the shop people were disinterested in what they were doing and it was very poor service.

Even though the place didn't had seating facility but its a good place for a hangout to REFRESH"

They have one of the best filter kaapi in Chennai. This is also a small stall like usual. I am giving 4 stars only because they don't have a place to sit. The staffs are also very friendly and courteous. Overall a recommended place to satiate your immediate filter kaapi craving. To top it off they have good selection of sides as well."

It's a quaint old coffee shop in Tnagar selling amazing coffee in a cute chocolate coated wafer cup ❤️

I tried their Vanilla and Hazelnut Coffee, it was worth every penny. The chocolate in the wafer cups added more flavour and it was an amazing coffee for 30 rupees.

This is definitely going to be my must visit shop in tnagar for an amazing coffee.

Special mention to their butter garlic masala buns - they costed 40 rupees and the flavours of garlic and herbs on a butter slathered hot bun was a great accompaniment while sipping hot coffee.

Do visit them and this spot is worth all the hype ✨

I took a birthday cake from here as it was an emergency and last minute order. Normally i would have skipped this place but it was open at night 11.45pm so took parcel from here. The cake 🍰 was good in taste but I think the layers are made from bread 🍞. No ambience, no proper lighting and you wouldn't expect any better seating here. Crowd comes here for late night coffee and expected crowd is of age 16 to 35. Nothing much to see here. They have coffee here which is famous. Most ordered here is falooda, fruit juice, cakes and coffee.

Ordered chappathi, which was really oily; I couldn't even chew it because it was so hard. I'm quite sorry I chose this location. It appeared that they had reheated the dinner from the previous day. The kurma too was very oily, so avoid this eatery and stay hungry. At the very least, you'll prevent food poisoning. They are unconcerned about customers or VFM.

This place is not so good. It's just average. Price wise it is good and taste is also good. But the environment is not upto the marks, like the indian coffee house in Delhi and chandigarh.
Overall it's a average place to eat. Service is just ok ok. Personally i don't recommend this restaurant to anyone as their are some better alternatives like Murugan idli, sangeetha in chennai.

This place is surely going to transport you back to the 60's where you get to experience the traditional chennai coffee and with a bit of modern twist by lemon tea. Haven't tried the food here but i can say the meals here are a hit where everyone is ordering it. The guy at the counter seems strict but is quite a nice guy who let us sit and wait out the rain and catch our bus home.

The hotel ambience is poorly maintained. Workers have no motivation to give proper service. They serve u lukewarm coffee. After 8 pm the parotta kuruma is invariably stale (twice experienced).

I am sad to see the way this place is mismanaged considering the way the same hotels are run in kerala. This despite being in the best location possible.

The workers aren't motivated to do proper service (starting from kitchen, to servers to cash counter) because theirs is more like a pseudo government entity. Job security is there.

The food items taste good but coffee somehow does not taste as prepared by professional coffee makers. Presentation of staff needs improvement. They are always grumpy. Seldom see smile on their faces while taking the order."

Too dirty... Not hygenic.. Am from kerala and I had an expectation before get in to the hotel that in Kerala most of the Indian Coffee Houses are above average standard. But here it is not good to have food. All the waiters are wearing dirty dresses. Poor quality food as well.

One of the very old restaurant brands in India. Once present all over south india. Now available only in Kerela and few parts of TN. Food quality will be average and they have their signature presentation in large plates with server with caps etc. This brand need renovation. Cost in par with other medium size hotels.

Located near T Nagar Bus Stand Chennai. Decades old. Though the inside ambience is ordinary, quality of food and service are good. Right price and tasty food.

Considering the food and coffee at this place, the shadiness of the place can be overlooked. The food is great in taste as well as price. As the name suggest, the coffee is amazing.
PS- please don't order a black coffee or Americano. They serve you a full cup of espresso"

Coffee is best here. Also we bought channa masala chat and samosa. They both are good. It is crowded during our visit (evening). Only thing is, surrounding place is not clean. So its not an option for elder prople. But definitely good option for friends, couples and working people.

1) The coffee ""quantity is less"" for the money paid.
2) if it is getting delayed for coffee due to milk is not hot, during billing it is to be informed, else one has to wait for the coffee
3) the quantity of sundal is gradually coming down but the rate remains the same.

NO VALUE FOR MONEY.
